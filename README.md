# 🍳 BelMawjud  — Intelligent Cooking Recommendation System

**BelMawjud Rewards** is an AI-powered mobile application designed to reduce household food waste by recommending recipes based on ingredients already available in the user’s kitchen. The system provides personalized cooking suggestions, preparation time estimates, and step-by-step instructions to simplify meal planning and enhance the cooking experience.

The application allows users to select ingredients, save favorite recipes, upload photos of prepared dishes, and rate meals to earn reward points. These points can be exchanged for real ingredients through partner Farm Superstores in Saudi Arabia, encouraging sustainable consumption and user engagement.

Built using **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile development, **Firebase** for backend and database management, and **Python-based machine learning models** for intelligent recommendations, the system follows an Agile development approach to support continuous improvement and scalability.

BelMawjud combines artificial intelligence, user-centered design, and reward-based interaction to promote smarter cooking habits, minimize food waste, and support sustainable lifestyle practices.
